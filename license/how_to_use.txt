How to use license in source code
---------------------------------

Basically the rule of thumb is to use the appropriate boilerplace in the code.
You will find all the different types of boilerplaces in the  boilerplates/ 
directory.

Here are a few examples of usages. You include in your source code at the
top of the file : 

boilerplate-jssl.java   - JSSL license for Java source files
boilerplate-jcddl.java  - JCDDL license for Java source files
boilerplate-jssl.jsp    - JSSL license file for JSP source files (.jsp, .inc)
boilerplate-jssl.xml    - JSSL license file for XML, XHTML and HTML files

Be careful though, inserting the wrong license can have important consequences
so make sure you differ between the open source license (JCDDL) and the non-
open source one (JSSL).

Also be careful when inserting licenses into certain files, which have 
requirements about what must be on the first line. This is especially true of
XML files, which must generally include a header such as this on the FIRST
line : 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

So you should put the boilerplate text below this header. This is also true
for certain XHTML files. You might also have to put the boilerplate text after 
any <!DOCTYPE> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

So finally here is an example of what a correct header might look like : 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
