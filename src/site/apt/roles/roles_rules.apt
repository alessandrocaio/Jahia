Roles/permissions related business rules

  Several rules are provided for an event-driven role/permission management in an automated way.
  The list of possible rule consequences (actions) can be found in the <<<WEB-INF/etc/repository/rules/rules.dsl>>>
  file, which contains rule consequences in JBoss Rules Domain Specific Language, like:
  
  * Grant role \{role\} on the \{node\} to the current user
  * Grant role \{role\} on the \{node\} to the user \{user\}
  * Revoke role \{role\} from everybody on the \{node\}
