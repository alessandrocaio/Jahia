    Copyright (C) 2002-2012 Jahia Solutions Group SA.

    Jahia's next-generation, open source CMS stems from a widely acknowledged vision of
    enterprise application convergence - web, search, document, social and portal - unified
    by the simplicity of web content management. Structured around Jahia Extended Content
    Management (xCM), the Jahia Studio, Jahiapps social and collaboration capabilities, and
    based on the powerful Jahia Composite Content Management platform, Jahia brings a unique
    modularity to the Java development arena. It is the tool of choice for building innovative
    user experiences for virtually any type of web application. For more information,
